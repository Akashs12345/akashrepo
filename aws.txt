VPC-VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD
IP ADDRESSES-INTRENET PROTOCOL:IT IS AN UNIQ ADDRESSES THAT IDENTIFIES A DEVICE ON THE INTERNET OR A LOCAL NETWORK.
5 KINDS OF IP RANGES
PRIVATE IP-USED WITH ALN NETWORK,UNIQ ONLY IN LAN;
PUBLIC IP-USED ON PUBLIC NETWORK,UNIQ ON GLOBALY;
IANA :INTERENET ASSIGNED NUMBER AUTORITY;
CLASS A RANGE:HAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF NETWORK.FIRST BIT(FIRST OCATATE),EVRY IP ADD IS  OF 8 BITS,WHOLE IP IS 32 BITS,OR 4 OCTATES,
1ST OCTATE IS FOR NETWORK;
LAST 3 OCTATE IS KNOWN FOR HOSTS;
CLASS B:FIRST TWO OCATE IS FOR NETWORK,LAST 2 OCTAATE FOR HOSTS,WHICH HAS MORE NETWORK IP,WHICH IS MORE USED BY ISPs(INTERENT SERVICE PROVIDERS);
CLASS C: FIRST 3 OCTATES IS FOR NETWORK,LAST 1 FOR HOST.
WHENEVER IP ADDRESSES IS:0-255 RANGE;
CIDR:classless inter domain routing;
CIDR NOTATION:IN which it contains 2 types of number 1)base ip,2)subnet mask
/ are used
24-32 last ocatet will change;
198.980.0.0;
32->2^0->1 we will ahve one ip add ->198.980.0.0;
21->
IANA has established certain blocks IPv4 

VPC IN AWS -IPv4:
you can have multiple VPCs in an AWS region(max 5 per region -soft limit)
min size -/28(16 ip add);
max size -/16(65,536 ip addresses);
subnet:network inside a network is known as subnet;
this break dwown of network is based on IP 
AWS reserves 5 IP  in each subnet;
BASTION HOSTS:Jump serevrs;
3 tier architechture of a web application;
NAT gateway:
